0.2.1
-- Allow create_document() to work even if given table already exists. Outputs the same as if it had created it.


0.2.0
-- Extension now requires PostgreSQL 9.5.
-- Changed from using exception trap to using INSERT ON CONFLICT (upsert) feature introduced in PostgreSQL 9.5. Concurrent inserts & updates to the same document ID should now be transactionally safe from race conditions.
-- Changed to using new json_set() function introduced in 9.5. Allows easier adding of automatic id value to a given document if one is not given to save_document().
-- Fixed bug where updated_at column was not being properly set when a document is updated.
-- Changed check_version() function to work with non-release versions of PostgreSQL. Not actually used in extension yet.
